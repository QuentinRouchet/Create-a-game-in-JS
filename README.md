# Doodle Jump

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to this workshop where we will create a Doodle Jump clone. We will work with vanilla Java Script. But don't worry, you will learn a lot of new things and be able to :

- Set up a physical system
- Create an hitbox
- Move a character
- Generate a level in a random way
- Display a score

But you need to know that we are going to mainly make object oriented. So if you're not confident with the object in JavaScript, it's your moment to learn!  

## Game presentation

In Doodle Jump you can jump, fall, and start over. The goal of the game is to try to go as high as possible and always get a better score than before. If you fall, you start over.

## The tutorial

First, please fork this repository. In the assets folder you will find the graphical assests. The HTML and CSS are already completed. Indeed, we will try to not waste too much time with things you already know.
